[["index.html", "How to make a histogram 1", " How to make a histogram 1 A histogram is a tool for representing the distribution of a dataset. The distribution is the frequency (how often) or probability (how likely) that values occur in different categories. A histogram is a graphical display of continuous data that are divided up into categories or bins. The histogram uses bars, where the width of each bar is the bin interval.
